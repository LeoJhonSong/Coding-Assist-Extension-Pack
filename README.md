# Coding Assist Extension Pack

This is a collection of extensions which are REALLY helpful in daily coding! I
would be glad if you are interested in this pack and just give a try! üëç

‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è before installation I suggest you read lines with ‚ö†Ô∏è tags first, where some requirements are mentioned.

## My tricks

Here are some tricks!üòÑ

VSCode sometimes stucks when too many extensions are installed? Here are two
tricks:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select **Developer: Open
   Process Explorer** to see which extensions cost most. Then disable (just
   workspace) some extensions you don't need in current workspace.
2. thinks disable extensions one by one too annoying? you can disable a group
   of extensions by simply disable **a extension pack**! ‚úåÔ∏è Another good news is
   that you can uninstall any extension included in the pack while this extension
   pack is still thereüéä
3. want to make your own extension pack? [This](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/03/07/extension-pack-roundup)
   may helps youüëç

## This pack includes

- [Trailing Spaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces) highlights trailing spaces which drives OCD
  (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) crazy üëç
- [Rewrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap) can
  wrap a block of code to given line length with a single key press. Different
  from language specific settings, you are able to wrap part of the file, for
  example the comments. It is also useful when you just want particular file
  wrapped instead of all this kind of file.
- [Indenticator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SirTori.indenticator) does well in visualizing indents.
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) could be super powerful when
  writing comments, or, someone use complete words as variable names. It could
  also be essential when writing Markdown in VSC.
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) colorize different levels of brackets
  with different, delightful colors, which helps a lot to match the brackets by
  eyes üëÄ
